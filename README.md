Rationale

This project rationale will discuss the game made for the Rhythm Slasher assignment. This rationale will also describe the process of making and designing the models within the game.
The game for the assignment is mean’t to be a clone that is a direct copy or in some way similar to the Beat Saber game and has to be virtual reality supported. The target audience for the game are for those who are in the 13+ age group and who can speak English. The game contains four scenes which are the following: 1) Main Menu, 2) Instructions, 3) Game and 4) End. The main menu has three buttons, one for the game, one for the instructions and one to exit the application which is also on the end scene. The instructions describe what the player needs to do when in the game scene. The end scene contains the credits and two buttons one of which allows you to go back to the game scene.
The process of making the game for the assignment is as follows. Wireframes made out for all scenes that would be in the game, a moodboard for the colour and text that would be used and a high-fidelity prototype of the game with samples of the models going to be used. The prototype, wireframes and moodboard were used as a guide to create the scenes and models for each scene. 
The assignment created some learning experiences when making the VR game. The unity project must contain the SteamVR plugin to allow it to be used for a headset, before building the game scenes the project must be VR supported which is in the player settings and the models must be scaled down to a very small size so it won’t take up too much space while testing the game with a VR headset. The game must also contain information about the assets or sounds used in the making of it.
