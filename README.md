# RythmSlasher
The game is a clone of Beat Saber. The models that are in the game were made in unity and 3ds Max. These models include the obstacles, spheres, cubes and the sabers. The game has a red background on all scenes of the VR game. The other objects that have a red material is one of the sabers, the obstacles and cube targets. The sphere targets and the other saber has a blue material. The buttons that are in the game also have a blue material and have white text. 
The target audience for the game must be English speaking and in the 13+ age group. The software used in making and building the scenes is Unity. There are four scenes that are in the final build of the game:
1)	Main Menu contains three buttons which are start, instructions and exit
2)	Instructions scene contains a button to go back and also information what to do while playing the game.
3)	Game scene contains the targets, obstacles, sabers and an exit button to go to the end scene.
4)	End scene contains the credits and two buttons which are retry and exit.

Rationale

This project rationale will discuss the game made for the Rhythm Slasher assignment. This rationale will also describe the process of making and designing the models within the game.
The game for the assignment is mean’t to be a clone that is a direct copy or in some way similar to the Beat Saber game and has to be virtual reality supported. The target audience for the game are for those who are in the 13+ age group and who can speak English. The game contains four scenes which are the following: 1) Main Menu, 2) Instructions, 3) Game and 4) End. The main menu has three buttons, one for the game, one for the instructions and one to exit the application which is also on the end scene. The instructions describe what the player needs to do when in the game scene. The end scene contains the credits and two buttons one of which allows you to go back to the game scene.
The process of making the game for the assignment is as follows. Wireframes made out for all scenes that would be in the game, a moodboard for the colour and text that would be used and a high-fidelity prototype of the game with samples of the models going to be used. The prototype, wireframes and moodboard were used as a guide to create the scenes and models for each scene. 
The assignment created some learning experiences when making the VR game. The unity project must contain the SteamVR plugin to allow it to be used for a headset, before building the game scenes the project must be VR supported which is in the player settings and the models must be scaled down to a very small size so it won’t take up too much space while testing the game with a VR headset. The game must also contain information about the assets or sounds used in the making of it.
